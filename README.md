## Welcome ðŸ‘‹! 

I'm Jeff Hale. This repo contains my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) solutions for 2021. I'm planning to do each challenge in vanilla Python and in Pandas (to the extent that makes sense). 

## Notes
Each day has its own Jupyter notebook. Data is in the data folder.



I teach, write, and consult about [Data Science](https://medium.com/@jeffhale) and [Python](https://memorablepython.com).
